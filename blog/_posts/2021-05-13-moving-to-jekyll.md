This blog is now built using `jekyll`, I previously used `lb` that was very minimalist but required writing the content of the posts in `html`, I could have created a pipeline to convert markdown into html but why make it so complicated when `jekyll` allows me to mix html in markdown and vice-versa.

My experience with `liquid` and `kramdown` has been amazing. Later I may include `mathjax` into the mix in case I need to write something 'math-intensive'. Another thing that I have been wanting to do for a long time is to create a profile page using [jemdoc][1]{: target="_blank"}, the formatting looks quite elegant even though it was created about 9 years ago. I will be customizing the css to make it similar to my site and add media queries for responsiveness.
