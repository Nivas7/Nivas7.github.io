Sometime this year, I realized that manually managing a cloud folder in google drive/one drive is a time consuming process. One needs to open the drive website and then manually upload the files to be updates/copied. These websites are large and take quite a lot of time to load and I find it specially frustating when I am in hurry and the uploading process doesn't even start.

During the short period of time I was at Warwick University, I needed to sync my library files between the university computer and my laptop and this is when I started to use google backup and sync. It is a nice utility but I don't want it to be running at all times as a system service so I disable it when not in use and run it only when I need to sync my files to the cloud. Because of some and some other anti-features I was looking for a software to replace it.
